# SQL_CASE_STUDY

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## The Problem
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

## Business Questions

#### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

`sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_amount
FROM
    dannys_diner.sales AS s
        JOIN
    dannys_diner.menu AS m USING (product_id)
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
`
#### Explaination:
- Use *SUM* and *GROUP BY* to find out total_amount contributed by each customer.
- Use *JOIN* to merge sales and menu tables as customer_id and price are from both tables.


| customer_id | total_amount |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

#### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?


`sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS total_visit_days
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
GROUP BY customer_id;
`
#### Explaination:
- Use *DISTINCT* and merge with *COUNT* to find out the total_visit_days for each customer.
#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

*
#### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
`sql
WITH sample_cte AS 
(SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_date,DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank
 FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
 JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m
 USING(product_id))
 
 SELECT customer_id, product_name AS first_item_bought
 FROM sample_cte
 WHERE rank = 1
 GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;
`
#### Explaination: 
- Create a temp table sample_cte and use *Windows function* with *DENSE_RANK* to create a new column rank based on order_date.
#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A's first orders are curry and sushi.
- Customer B's first order is curry.
- Customer C's first order is ramen.
*
### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
`sql
SELECT m.product_name, COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
USING(product_id)
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
`
#### Explaination:
- *COUNT* number of product_id and *ORDER BY* purchase_count by descending order. 
#### Answer:
| prodcut_name | purchase_count | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ramen       | 8 |

*

### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
`sql
WITH fav_item AS
( SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name, COUNT(s.product_id) AS order_count,
 DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(s.customer_id) DESC) AS rank
 
 FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
 JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m
 USING(product_id)
 GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name)
 
 SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_count
 FROM fav_item
 WHERE rank = 1;
 `
 #### Explaination:
 - Create a fav_item and use *DENSE_RANK* to rank the order_count for each product by descending order for each customer.
- Generate results where product rank = 1 only as the most popular product for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

*
### 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
`sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    s.product_id,
    m.join_date,
    s.order_date,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank
  FROM
    dannys_diner.sales AS s
  JOIN
    dannys_diner.members AS m
    ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
  WHERE
    s.order_date >= m.join_date
)
SELECT
  s.customer_id,
  s.order_date,
  m2.product_name
FROM
  cte AS s
JOIN
  dannys_diner.menu AS m2
  ON s.product_id = m2.product_id
WHERE
  rank = 1;
`
 #### Explaination:

- Create cte by using *windows function* and partitioning customer_id by ascending order_date. Then, filter order_date to be on or after join_date.
- Then, filter table by rank = 1 to show 1st item purchased by each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2021-01-07 | curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-11 | sushi        |

* 

### 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
`sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    s.product_id,
    m.join_date,
    s.order_date,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rank
  FROM
    dannys_diner.sales AS s
  JOIN
    dannys_diner.members AS m
    ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
  WHERE
    s.order_date < m.join_date
)
SELECT
  s.customer_id,
  s.order_date,
  m2.product_name
FROM
  cte AS s
JOIN
  dannys_diner.menu AS m2
  ON s.product_id = m2.product_id
WHERE
  rank = 1;
  `
  #### Explaination:
  - Create a cte to create new column rank by using *Windows function* and partitioning customer_id by descending order_date to find out the last order_date before customer becomes a member.
- Filter order_date < join_date.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2021-01-01 |  sushi        |
| A           | 2021-01-01 |  curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-04 |  sushi        |

### 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

`sql
SELECT 
 s.customer_id, SUM(m2.price),COUNT(DISTINCT m2.product_id)
 FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
 JOIN dannys_diner.members AS m
 ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
 JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m2
 ON s.product_id = m2.product_id
 WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
 GROUP BY s.customer_id;
 `
 #### Explaination:
 - Filter order_date < join_date and perform a *COUNT* *DISTINCT* on product_id and *SUM* the price before becoming member.

 #### Answer:
| customer_id | DISTINCT_product | SUM_sales |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 2 |  40       |
